 * Description: Calculations of patient's BMR and TEE. This program is designed 
 * interacts with a nurse but may be used by clients as well.
 * Comment: For this assignment, I have included a total of five methods. The main 
 * method has a while loop. The while loop check if data is valid before 
 * calculating the BMR and the TEE. If the condition is true, then the statement 
 * inside the while loop will execute. Two of the methods are for converting units 
 * and the other two methods are for calculating the BMR and the TEE. In the BMR
 * and the TEE calculators, I have included the if and if-else statements. 
 * When we need to execute a set of statements based on a condition, then we need 
 * to use the if or if-else statements. In this case, we have two printed statements
 * in the bmrCalculator, but only one print statement executes at a time based 
 * on the input. I've also included an error trapping to ensure that a number lies 
 * in between my limits. Within the error trapping, I included a while loop that
 * repeatedly asks for the correct values if an incorrect value is entered.
